<h2>Accept that relapse is a part of recovery</h2>
<p>
There is no magic formula involved with staying clean and sober after a relapse from drugs and alcohol. Staying clean and sober every day means living by the Sober Living Code.

The longer you stay clean and sober after a relapse into addiction, the better chances you’ll have of achieving lasting sobriety. You should continue to attend meetings while in Sober Living, which will help reinforce your abstinence from drugs and alcohol for many years to follow. If there are no meetings available in Sober Living, then consider finding a meeting close to where you’re relocating when leaving Sober Living after a relapse into addiction.
